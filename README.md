# Hyperparameter Optimization  
A project exploring different hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve machine learning model performance. This project follows the tutorial **"Hyperparameter Optimization: This Tutorial Is All You Need"**.

## Features  
- Implements Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization  
- Compares different optimization methods on a machine learning model  
- Uses libraries like `scikit-learn`, `optuna`, and `hyperopt`  
- Provides visualizations of optimization results
